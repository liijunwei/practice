+ Separate general-purpose and special-purpose code
    + separate command and query
    + separate operations that have and have no side-effects
    + ...

+ Red Flag: Repetition

+ The way to separate special-purpose code from general-purpose code is to *pull the special-purpose code upwards, into the higher layers, leaving the lower layers general-purpose*.
+ When you encounter a class that includes both general-purpose and special-purpose features for the same abstraction, see if the class can be separated into two classes, one containing the general-purpose features, and the other layered on top of it to provide the special-purpose features.
