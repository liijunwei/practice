+ In my experience, the sweet spot is to implement new modules in a somewhat general-purpose fashion.
+ The phrase “somewhat general-purpose” means that the module’s functionality should reflect your current needs, but its interface should not.
    + Instead, the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses.
    + The interface should be easy to use for today’s needs without being tied specifically to them.

+ generic api for text editor
    + `void insert(Position position, String newText);`
    + `void delete(Position start, Position end);`
    + `Position changePosition(Position position, int numChars);`
    + 这个例子好呀...

+ Generality leads to better information hiding

+ "false abstraction"

+ **One of the most important elements of software design is determining who needs to know what, and when.**
+ When the details are important, it is better to make them explicit and as obvious as possible, such as the revised implementation of the backspace operation.
+ Hiding this information behind an interface just creates obscurity.

+ Here are some questions you can ask yourself, which will help you to find the right balance between `general-purpose` and `special-purpose` for an interface.
    + What is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs?
    + In how many situations will this method be used?
    + Is this API easy to use for my current needs?
