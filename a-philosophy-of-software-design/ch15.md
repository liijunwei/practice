+ The best time to write comments is at the beginning of the process, as you write the code.
+ Writing the comments first makes documentation part of the design process.(something like TDD)
+ Not only does this produce better documentation, but it also produces better designs and it makes the process of writing documentation more enjoyable.

+ Even if you do have the self-discipline to go back and write the comments (and don’t fool yourself: you probably don’t), the comments won’t be very good.

+ Comments are a design tool
+ To write a good comment, **you must identify the essence of a variable or piece of code: what are the most important aspects of this thing?**
+ It’s important to *do this early in the design process*; otherwise you are just hacking code.

+ Red Flag: Hard to Describe
    + The comment that describes a method or variable should be simple and yet complete.
    + If you find it difficult to write such a comment, that’s an indicator that there may be a problem with the design of the thing you are describing.

+ Writing the comments first will mean that the abstractions will be more stable before you start writing code. This will probably save time during coding.

+ **If you haven’t ever tried writing the comments first, give it a try. Stick with it long enough to get used to it.**
