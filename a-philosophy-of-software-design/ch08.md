Pull Complexity Downwards -> deep module

+ Suppose that you are developing a new module, and you discover a piece of unavoidable complexity. Which is better:
    + should you let users of the module deal with the complexity
    + or should you handle the complexity internally within the module?

+ you should avoid configuration parameters as much as possible
+ Before exporting a configuration parameter, ask yourself: "will users (or higher-level modules) be able to determine a better value than we can determine here?"
+ When you do create configuration parameters, see if you can compute reasonable defaults automatically
+ configuration parameters result in an incomplete solution, which adds to system complexity

+ Pulling complexity down makes the most sense if
    + the complexity being pulled down is closely related to the class’s existing functionality
    + pulling the complexity down will result in many simplifications elsewhere in the application
    + pulling the complexity down simplifies the class’s interface

+ Remember that the goal is to *minimize overall system complexity*.
+ When developing a module, look for opportunities to take a little bit of extra suffering upon yourself in order to reduce the suffering of your users.
