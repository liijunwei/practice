+ I hope these chapters will convince you of three things:
    1. good comments can make a big difference in the overall quality of software
    2. it isn’t hard to write good comments
    3. (this may be hard to believe) writing comments can actually be fun

+ excuse: "Good code is self-documenting"
    + "Unfortunately, it’s simply not true."
    + why?
    + design decision / the conditions / the overall usage... can't be expressed without comments

+ In addition, if you write code with the expectation that users will read method implementations, you will try to make each method as short as possible, so that it’s easy to read. If the method does anything nontrivial, you will break it up into several smaller methods. This will result in a large number of shallow methods.

没有注释 -> 期望其他人读代码的实现 -> 代码要写的简单，方法很短 -> 导致一大堆shallow methods
(我看起来没问题啊... >x<)

+ "If users must read the code of a method in order to use it, then there is no abstraction"
    + 赞同啊... 不过文件名/类名/方法名不就已经传达出这个信息了吗？

+ If you want to use abstractions to hide complexity, comments are essential.
+ 理解并赞同注释的重要性，不过觉得最主要还是在 重要的信息(比如设计决策/简短描述)之类的地方加，需要注释的地方肯定是少数代码

+ Software projects are almost always under time pressure, and there will always be things that seem higher priority than writing comments.
+ Thus, if you allow documentation to be de- prioritized, you’ll end up with no documentation.

+ many of the most important comments are those related to abstractions, such as the top-level documentation for classes and methods.

+ excuse: "All the comments I have seen are worthless"
    + Fortunately, this problem is solvable; writing solid documentation is not hard, once you know how.

+ **The overall idea behind comments is to capture information that was in the mind of the designer but couldn’t be represented in the code.**
    + low-level details
    + high-level concepts
写注释是为了把在代码里很难或者没法展现的信息通过注释记录下来
