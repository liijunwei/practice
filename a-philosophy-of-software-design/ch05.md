+ Chapter 4 argued that modules should be deep.
+ This chapter, and the next few that follow, discuss **techniques for creating deep modules**.

+ The most important technique for achieving deep modules is information hiding.
    + The basic idea is that each module should encapsulate a few pieces of *knowledge*, which represent design decisions.
    + The knowledge is embedded in the module's implementation but does not appear in its interface, so it is not visible to other modules.

+ Information hiding reduces complexity in two ways:
    1. it simplifies the interface to a module
    2. information hiding makes it easier to evolve the system

+ When designing a new module, you should think carefully about what information can be hidden in that module.
+ If you can hide more information, you should also be able to simplify the moduleâ€™s interface, and this makes the module deeper.
