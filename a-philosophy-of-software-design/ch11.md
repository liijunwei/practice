+ **You’ll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple options for each major design decision: design it twice.**
+ Try to pick approaches that are radically different(截然不同的) from each other; *you’ll learn more that way*.
+ Even if you are certain that there is only one reasonable approach, consider a second design anyway, no matter how bad you think it will be.

+ After you have roughed out the designs for the alternatives, make a list of the pros and cons of each one.
    + The most important consideration for an interface is ease of use for higher level software.

+ The design-it-twice principle can be applied at many levels in a system.
    + two services
    + module/class
    + implementation

+ Designing it twice does not need to take a lot of extra time.

+ ["Focus on making it work, but then spend 5-10 minutes before each commit and polish. I often write 2 or 3 versions of a paragraph of code and weigh my options."](https://www.zenspider.com/ruby/2012/09/career-advice.html)

+ if you want to get really great results, you have to consider a second possibility, or perhaps a third, no matter how smart you are.
+ the design of large software systems falls in this category: no-one is good enough to get it right with their first try.

+ The design-it-twice approach not only improves your designs, but it also improves your design skills.
