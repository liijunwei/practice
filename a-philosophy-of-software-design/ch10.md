+ This chapter discusses why exceptions contribute disproportionately to complexity, then it shows how to simplify exception handling.
+ The key overall lesson from this chapter is to reduce the number of places where exceptions must be handled

+ I use the term exception to refer to any uncommon condition that *alters the normal flow of control in a program.*
任何可以打破程序正常顺序执行流的事件/条件 都算异常

+ An exception disrupts the normal flow of the code; it usually means that something didn’t work as expected.

+ Exceptions don’t occur very often in running systems, so exception handling code rarely executes.
+ Bugs can go undetected for a long time, and when the exception handling code is finally needed, there’s a good chance that it won’t work (one of my favorite sayings: "code that hasn’t been executed doesn’t work").
+ A recent study found that more than *90% of catastrophic failures* in distributed data-intensive systems were caused by incorrect error handling1.
+ When exception handling code fails, it’s difficult to debug the problem, since it occurs so *infrequently*.
异常相对于正常情况，出现的次数更少，所以处理的代码被执行的机会更少，而且处理异常的代码也可能产生新的异常，由于这些原因导致异常处理代码变得很复杂

+ It’s *tempting* to use exceptions to avoid dealing with difficult situations: rather than figuring out a clean way to handle it, just throw an exception and punt the problem to the caller.
+ Generating an exception in a situation like this just passes the problem to someone else and adds to the system’s complexity.
+ **The exceptions thrown by a class are part of its interface; classes with lots of exceptions have complex interfaces, and they are shallower than classes with fewer exceptions.**
不经思考的随意抛出异常是偷懒的行为，会增加系统的复杂度；一个会抛出较少异常的接口比会抛出很多异常的接口更 "深(deep)"

+ The best way to reduce the complexity damage caused by exception handling is to *reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled*.
+ The rest of this chapter will discuss *four techniques* for reducing the number of exception handlers.
减少由于异常处理代码增加的系统复杂度的最好办法是 尽量减少抛出异常，确认清楚在抛出异常的地方，有没有更清晰更简单的处理方式
本章接下来的部分会介绍4种降低复杂度的方法
