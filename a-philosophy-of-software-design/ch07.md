+ Software systems are composed in layers, where higher layers use the facilities provided by lower layers.
+ In a well-designed system, each layer provides a different abstraction from the layers above and below it;
    + one more level of abstraction above the current one

+ If a system contains adjacent(临近的) layers with similar abstractions, this is a red flag that suggests a problem with the class decomposition.
+ This chapter discusses situations where this happens, the problems that result, and how to refactor to eliminate the problems.

+ `A pass-through method` is one that does little except invoke another method, whose signature is similar or identical to that of the calling method.

+ Red Flag: Pass-Through Method
    + This typically indicates that there is not a *clean division of responsibility between the classes*.
