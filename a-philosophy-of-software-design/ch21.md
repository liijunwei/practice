+ This book is about one thing: complexity

+ If you aren’t used to thinking about design issues, then you will slow down even more while you learn good design techniques
+ If the only thing that matters to you is making your current code work as soon as possible, then thinking about design will seem like drudge work that is getting in the way of your real goal
+ If good design is an important goal for you, then the ideas in this book should make programming more fun
    + how can a particular problem be solved with the simplest possible structure?
    + It’s fun to explore different approaches, and it’s a great feeling to discover a solution that is both simple and powerful
    + A clean, simple, and obvious design is a beautiful thing

+ The investments you make in good design will pay off quickly
+ The reward for being a good designer is that you get to spend a larger fraction of your time in the design phase, which is fun.
+ Poor designers spend most of their time chasing bugs in complicated and brittle code.
+ If you improve your design skills, not only will you produce higher quality software more quickly, but the software development process will be more enjoyable.
