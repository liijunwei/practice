## First story: about connecting the dots

17 years later I did go to college and all of my working-class parents savings will be spent on my college tuition

after six months I couldn't see the value in it I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out

so I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay

it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made

the minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting

it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a dorm room so I slept on the floor and friends rooms I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with

and I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna temple

and much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on

**you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards**

**so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future, you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma**

**whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path**

**and that will make all the difference**

## Second story: about love and loss

**it was awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it**

sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick, don't lose faith

**I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did**

**you've got to find what you love**

**and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers**

**your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work**

**and the ONLY way to do great work is to LOVE what you do**

**if you haven't found it yet, KEEP LOOKING and DON'T SETTLE**

**as with all matters of the heart: you'll know when you find it**

**and like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on**

**so keep looking don't settle**

**if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right**

for the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:

if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today
