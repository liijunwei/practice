practice project from "Let's Go Further"

and after it's done, I plan to make this project a "helper" api backend for many other purposes

- router example: https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/stdlib/route.go

- TODO practice cursor based pagination
- TODO try another email package
    - less dependency
    - https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/wiki/Simple-Mailer-Example
