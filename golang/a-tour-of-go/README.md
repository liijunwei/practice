[Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)

To run the tour locally, you'll need to first install Go and then run:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest
```

This will place a tour binary in your [GOPATH's](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_and_Modules) bin directory. When you run the tour program, it will open a web browser displaying your local version of the tour.

Of course, you can continue to take the tour through this web site.
