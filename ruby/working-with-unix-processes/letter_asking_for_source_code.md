I've read your great book "Working With Unix Processes" these days, And to be honest, this is the first book teaching me about"Unix Programming".

Now I got the necessary knowledge(power) to read and complex code, actually I understand the booting process for "Resque", "Puma" and "Sidekiq" after these tutorials.ðŸ˜œ

I've taken some notes [here](https://github.com/liijunwei/practice/tree/main/ruby/working-with-unix-processes).

Your book is easy and fun to read, Thanks for making [them](https://workingwithruby.com/) free. ;D

Last thing, please share the code project mentioned in [Appendix: Spyglass](https://workingwithruby.com/wwup/spyglass/), I googled it and found [this one](https://github.com/d-bot/spyglass), but it might not be offical...

Good Day!
