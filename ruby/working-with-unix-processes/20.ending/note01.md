# [Ending](https://workingwithruby.com/wwup/ending/)

+ Working with processes in Unix is about two things:
    + abstraction
    + communication.

+ In the end, all of our code is compiled down to something simple that the kernel can understand.

+ Using Unix programming lets you do things that you can’t accomplish when working at the programming language level.

+ Unix programming is programming language agnostic.
    + It lets you reuse its concepts across programming languages.

+ Besides the basic act of creating new processes, almost everything else we talked about was regarding communication.

+ Using signals any two processes on the system can communicate with each other.
    + By naming your processes you can communicate with any user who is inspecting your program on the command line.
    + Using exit codes you can send success/failure messages to any process that’s looking after your own.

## Farewell, But Not Goodbye

> That’s the end! Congratulations for making it here! **Believe it or not, you now know more than most programmers about the inner workings of Unix processes.**

hhhhh

+ Now that you know the fundamentals you can go out apply your newfound knowledge to anything that you work on.
+ Things are going to start making more sense for you.
+ And the more you apply your newfound knowledge: the clearer things will become.
+ There’s no stopping you now.
