+ Working with processes in Unix is about two things:
    + abstraction
    + communication.

+ In the end, all of our code is compiled down to something simple that the kernel can understand.

+ Using Unix programming lets you do things that you canâ€™t accomplish when working at the programming language level.

+ Unix programming is programming language agnostic.
    + It lets you reuse its concepts across programming languages.

+ Besides the basic act of creating new processes, almost everything else we talked about was regarding communication.
