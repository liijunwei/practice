+ Code should be open for extension and closed for modification.

+  If anything, the current incarnation is less amenable to this requirement than was Shameless Green.

当前代码虽然已经移除了一些code smell, 从代码中提取出了一些隐含的概念, 但是还不是符合开闭原则的代码

关于重构的事实是: 重构有可能使得现状变得更糟

重构不能保证最终的代码表达能力更强, 能更好的描述问题

重构仅能使得代码更易于添加代码和回滚代码变更

+ Proper refactoring allows you to explore a problem domain safely.

正确的重构能让你对问题的探索变得容易和安全
