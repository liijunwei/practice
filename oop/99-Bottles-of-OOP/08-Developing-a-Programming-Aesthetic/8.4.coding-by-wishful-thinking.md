+ Software developers have long relied on structured speculation.

软件开发人员长期以来一直依赖于结构化的推测

+ Like pseudocode and TDD, coding by wishful thinking allows you to sketch software design ideas economically, with a low level of commitment.

与伪代码和TDD一样, 通过"wishful thinking"方式进行编码, 可以让您以低代价勾勒出软件设计思想

+ Think about this from the message sender’s point of view: What does Bottles want from BottleVerse?

+ Coding by wishful thinking led to the discovery of a more intention-revealing(揭示意图的代码) interface for BottleVerse.

描述意图，而非描述实现

+ If you plug BottleVerse into Bottles and tests fail, the rules of refactoring say you must undo and fix the offending code.

+ If you can’t immediately fix the problem, either drop back and use the original technique that takes smaller steps, or TDD the new BottleVerse.
