+ Developing a Programming Aesthetic

培养编程美学(???) 审美/品味

+ The process has been both prescriptive and proscriptive; the refactoring recipes tell you what to do while at the same time forbidding you from wandering off to tinker on tangental shiny things.

这个过程既有规定性又有禁止性

重构方法告诉你该怎么做, 同时(暂时)又禁止你去修补那些无关紧要的东西

+ Voluntarily altering working code costs money, and doing so declares that you believe that rearranging this code right now is more important than anything else on the backlog.

主动提出修改当前"正常工作的代码"是有成本的

并且提出这件事的时候, 其实暗示了你认为这件事比其他所有积压的事都重要

+ The opportunity cost of improving existing code is that you can’t simultaneously attend to other urgent things.

由于机会成本, 你把时间活在了重构以提高代码质量上, 那么就不能去做其他更重要的事了

+ Code smells and refactoring recipes represent the distilled judgement of many deeply experienced OO practitioners.

code smell 和 重构的方法代表了很多经验丰富的面向对象实践者的精髓的判断

+ Close attention to ultimate outcomes led them to develop a sense of what to actively do (or diligently avoid) in present code to preclude future pain.

对最终代码的密切关注使经验丰富的程序员意识到应该关注什么方面, 应该怎么做, 做什么 才能避免以后的痛苦

+ They developed a feeling, an "aesthetic", about the rightness of code, and this aesthetic guided their decisions in times of confusion and uncertainty.

他们对代码的正确性产生了一种感觉, 一种"审美", 这种审美在代码还处于混乱和不确定状态的时候指导着他们的决策
