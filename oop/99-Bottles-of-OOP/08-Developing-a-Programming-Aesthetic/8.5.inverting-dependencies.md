+ impetus [ˈɪmpɪtəs]  动力/势头

+ Recall that the impetus behind extracting BottleVerse was the need to produce songs with other lyrics.

回想我们从Bottles类里面抽取出BottleVerse类的动机是 满足为不同诗句产生不同歌词的需求

+ Despite having completed the extraction, you can’t yet fulfill this vary-the-verse requirement.

尽管目前已经实现了提取出新的类, 但是现在还是满足不了新需求

+ Why not? Because Bottles is currently stuck to BottleVerse. You have extracted the class, but not yet inverted the dependency.

为什么不行呢? 因为Bottles类现在 依赖了一个写死的 BottleVerse(Hardcoded)

我们只抽取了类, 但是没有反转依赖关系(Bottle 类应该依赖于接口, 而非 具体的 BottleVerse)

+ The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) contributes the 'D' in the SOLID acronym and can be defined as "depend on abstractions, not concretions."

依赖反转原则是说 我们的代码应该依赖于抽象, 而不应该依赖于具体的实现

## 8.5.1. Injecting Dependencies

+ It’s time to loosen the coupling between Bottles and BottleVerse.

+ Bottles depends on(has knowledge about) two different BottleVerse-related things:
    1. a concretion, that is, the name of the BottleVerse class, and
    2. an abstraction, namely, the idea that there’s an object that can provide a verse.

Bottles依赖于BottleVerse相关类的两部分

1. 类的具体的实现
2. 抽象的某个类的实例 能够产生诗句

+ Knowing the abstraction is required.

其中对抽象知识部分的依赖是必要且不可避免的

+ Knowing about the concretion, on the other hand, is completely avoidable.

但是对具体实现细节的依赖确实可以避免的

+ Bottles doesn’t have to know the concrete class name BottleVerse, this name could easily be passed into Bottles from the outside.

Bottles类不需要知道BottleVerse的具体实现, 它可以很容易的通关其他方式注入到Bottle类中

+ Doing so not only reduces the number of dependencies inside of Bottles, but it also opens Bottles to an entire universe of existing and potential lyrics providers.

这么做不仅可以减少Bottles内部的依赖, 并且使得Bottles变得对扩展开放

+ You can think of classes that provide lyrics as playing a common role.

可以将产生诗句的类视为充当某种角色

+ Roles need names, and this role could reasonably be named verse template.

这种角色我们给它起名为 "verse_template"

+ Question: when injecting collaborators/dependencies, should you inject classes or instances of those classes?

## 8.5.2. Isolating Variants

+ Bottles now thinks of itself as interacting with a player of the verse template role rather than a kind of the BottleVerse type.

`Bottle` 类在注入了依赖以后，就不是和一个具体的类协作了，而是和一个 接口 协作

+ Bottles can produce as many different songs as you have different verse templates, without itself changing.

+ Here’s the process used to create the verse template role:
    1. Identify the code you want to vary.
    2. Name the underlying concept.
    3. Extract the identified code into its own class.
    4. Inject this new role-playing object back into the object from which it was extracted.
    5. Forward messages from the original class to the injected object.

发现 verse_template 这个角色的过程:
1. 识别出产生不同之处的代码
2. 为概念命名
3. 将相同部分提取成单独的类
4. 将不同的template通过依赖注入的方式加入到单独的类里
5. 将信息从原来的类转发给注入的实例

+ **This process can be summarized in a few words: Isolate the behavior you want to vary.**

上述过程可以用一句简单的话概括: 将你想要改变的行为隔离开(**把变化隔离出去**)

+ One of the most fundamental concepts in OO is to isolate the behavior you want to vary.

面向对象最基本的一个概念就是 要把想要改变的行为给隔离开

+ Isolating the bottles variant of the verse template opens your code to the possibility of other variants.

+ It’s now possible to fulfill the current requirement by creating and injecting a new class that plays this role.

## 8.5.3. Grappling with Inversion

+ The key to understanding the principle is to recognize that your code should depend on abstractions.

理解Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)的关键在于 要意识到 我们的代码应该依赖于抽象, 而不是依赖于具体的实现

+ Where Bottles once had a dependency on the BottleVerse concretion, it now has a dependency on the verse template abstraction. Thus the original dependency has been inverted.

例如 之前 Bottles 依赖于 具体的实现类BottleVerse

在提取出 `verse_template` 概念后, Bottles 不在依赖于具体的实现类了, 它现在依赖于名为 verse_template 的抽象概念

所以 原来 依赖于具体实现, 现在依赖于抽象概念, 依赖被翻转了

+ [Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
    + High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
    + Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

+ In this definition module means an encapsulated, named unit of functionality in a program.

上述的 `module` 指的是封装, 一段实现了具体功能的代码段

+ Bottles is thus the highest-level module in the code.
+ The entire public API is currently defined in Bottles.
+ Every other class was created by extracting behavior from the high-level module Bottles.
+ These extracted classes represent lower-level modules.

+ rephrased 重新措辞/换个说法说/改变词句

+ In terms of the current code, the official Dependency Inversion Principle definition can be rephrased as:
    1. High-level modules like Bottles should not depend on lower-level modules like BottleVerse. Each should depend on abstractions.
    2. Bottles should not depend on concrete details like the name of the BottleVerse class. Bottles should instead depend on an object that polymorphically generates song verses.

用现有代码来理解依赖倒置原则

1. 高层模块(Bottles)不应该依赖于底层的模块(BottleVerse), 他俩都应该依赖于抽象
2. Bottles 不应该依赖于具体的实现(例如 BottleVerse的名字), Bottles应该依赖于能够通过多态生成不同诗句的类实例
