+ **New requirement: Your customer wants other songs that are similar to "99 Bottles" but contain different lyrics.**

+ When your customer asks you to produce other songs like the "99 Bottles" song, they’re asking you to write code to produce other songs that also count down.

+ Follow the Open-Closed Flowchart:

1. Is the code open to the vary the verses requirement?

NO

2. Do you know how to make it open?

have no idea

3. What’s the best-understood code smell?

have no idea

+ Paradoxically, when faced with uncertainty about what to do next, it can sometimes help to sigh deeply, ignore everything you’ve learned, and just write a new conditional.
