+ The code you write should meet two often contradictory goals.
    + It must remain concrete enough to be understood
    + It must simultaneously being abstract enough to allow for change.

我们写的代码需要达成两个看似矛盾的目标: 他必须足够具体, 让人能看得懂; 他必须足够抽象, 让它自己易于被维护, 易于做出改变/调整

+ Imagine a continuum(连续体) with "most concrete" at one end and "most abstract" at the other.
    + Code at the concrete end might be expressed as a single long procedure full of if statements.
    + Code at the abstract end might consist of many classes, each with one method containing a single line of code.
    + The best solution for most problems lies not at the extremes of this continuum, but somewhere in the middle.

想象一个连续体, 它的一头A是"最具体", 另一头B是"最抽象"
那么
  A可以理解为 一大堆的`if/else条件`分隔的代码逻辑
  B可以理解为 一大堆的`class`, 每个类完成固定的事, 类里的方法可能多数都只有一行代码

最优解不在两个端点, 而在中间的某个位置, 这个位置就是平衡点

+ There’s a sweet spot that represents the perfect compromise between comprehension and changeability, and it’s your job as a programmer to find it.

这个点能很好的做出对 易理解性 和 易变性 的权衡, 作为软件工程师, 找到它, 实现它是我们的本职

+ This section discusses **four different solutions to the 99 Bottles of Beer problem**. These solutions vary in complexity and thus illustrate different points along this continuum.

+ As you were forewarned in the preface, the best way to learn from this book is to work the exercises yourself.

学习本书的最好方法就是 敲代码并且练习

+ contaminated 受到污染的

+ Therefore, if you plan to work along, **go do the 99 Bottles exercise now**. When you’re finished, you’ll be ready to examine the following four solutions.
