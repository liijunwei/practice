+ You judge code constantly.

+ Writing code requires making choices; the choices you make reflect personal, internalized criteria.

+ You intend to write "good" code and if, in your estimation, you’ve written "bad" code, you are clearly aware that you’ve done so.

+ Regardless of how implicit, unachievable, or unhelpful they may be, you already have rules about code.

+ Answering the question "What makes code good?" thus requires defining goodness in concrete and actionable ways. This is harder than one might think.
