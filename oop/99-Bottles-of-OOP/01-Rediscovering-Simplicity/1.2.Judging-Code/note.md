+ You judge code constantly.

+ Writing code requires making choices; the choices you make reflect personal, internalized criteria.

+ You intend to write "good" code and if, in your estimation, you’ve written "bad" code, you are clearly aware that you’ve done so.

+ Regardless of how implicit, unachievable, or unhelpful they may be, you already have rules about code.

+ Answering the question "What makes code good?" thus requires defining goodness in concrete and actionable ways. This is harder than one might think.

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient.

> Clean code is full of crisp abstractions

> Clean code was written by someone who cares.

+ **Any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but is also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable.**

+ The problem with these definitions is that although they accurately describe how good code looks once it’s written, **they give no help with achieving this state, and provide little guidance for choosing between competing solutions. The attributes they use to describe good code are qualitative, not quantitative.**

+ Metrics are fallible but human opinion is no more precise. Checking metrics regularly will keep you humble and improve your code.

代码的质量应该多用指标工具去检测

+ As programmers grow, they get better at solving challenging problems, and become comfortable with complexity.
+ This higher level of comfort sometimes leads to the belief that complexity is inevitable, as if it’s the natural, inescapable state of all finished code.
+ However, there’s something beyond complexity --- a higher level of simplicity.
+ **Infinitely experienced programmers do not write infinitely complex code; they write code that’s blindingly simple.**

复杂 是可以避免的

"更高层次的简洁" 是 "复杂" 下一阶段, 或者目标

有经验的程序员不会写出很复杂难懂的代码, 他们会把代码变得很简单, 清晰易懂, 同时能解决问题
