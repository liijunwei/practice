+ You judge code constantly.

+ Writing code requires making choices; the choices you make reflect personal, internalized criteria.

+ You intend to write "good" code and if, in your estimation, you’ve written "bad" code, you are clearly aware that you’ve done so.

+ Regardless of how implicit, unachievable, or unhelpful they may be, you already have rules about code.

+ Answering the question "What makes code good?" thus requires defining goodness in concrete and actionable ways. This is harder than one might think.

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient.

> Clean code is full of crisp abstractions

> Clean code was written by someone who cares.

+ **Any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but is also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable.**

+ The problem with these definitions is that although they accurately describe how good code looks once it’s written, **they give no help with achieving this state, and provide little guidance for choosing between competing solutions. The attributes they use to describe good code are qualitative, not quantitative.**
