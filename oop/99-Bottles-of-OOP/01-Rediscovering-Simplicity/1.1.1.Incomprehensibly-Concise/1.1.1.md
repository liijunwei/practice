+ Creating a method requires identifying the code you’d like to extract and deciding on a method name. This, in turn, requires naming the concept, and naming things is just plain hard.

+ When you first write a piece of code, you obviously know what it does. Therefore, during initial development, the price you pay for poor names is relatively low. However, code is read many more times than it is written, and its ultimate cost is often very high and paid by someone else.

+ Writing code is like writing a book; your efforts are for other readers. Although the struggle for good names is painful, it is worth the effort if you wish your efforts to survive to be read. Code clarity is built upon names.

+ Independent of all judgment about how well a bit of code is arranged, code is also charged with doing what it’s supposed to do now as well as being easy to alter so that it can do more later.

+ While it’s difficult to get exact figures for value and cost, asking the following questions will give you insight into the potential expense of a bit of code:
    + 1. How difficult was it to write?
    + 2. How hard is it to understand?
    + 3. How expensive will it be to change?

+ Duplication of logic suggests that there are concepts hidden in the code that are not yet visible because they haven’t been isolated and named.

+ Terminology: Method versus Message(方法和消息的区别) 对 **他俩是有区别的**
    + A "method" is defined on an object, and contains behavior.
    + In the example, the `Bottle` class defines a method named song
    + A "message" is sent by an object to invoke behavior. In the aforementioned example, the song method sends the verses message to the implicit receiver self.
    + **Therefore, methods are defined, and messages are sent.**
    + Think of objects as black boxes. Methods are defined within a black box. Messages are passed between them.
