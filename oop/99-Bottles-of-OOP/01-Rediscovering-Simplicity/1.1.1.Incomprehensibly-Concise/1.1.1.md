+ Creating a method requires identifying the code you’d like to extract and deciding on a method name. This, in turn, requires naming the concept, and naming things is just plain hard.

+ When you first write a piece of code, you obviously know what it does. Therefore, during initial development, the price you pay for poor names is relatively low. However, code is read many more times than it is written, and its ultimate cost is often very high and paid by someone else.

+ Writing code is like writing a book; your efforts are for other readers. Although the struggle for good names is painful, it is worth the effort if you wish your efforts to survive to be read. Code clarity is built upon names.

+ Independent of all judgment about how well a bit of code is arranged, code is also charged with doing what it’s supposed to do now as well as being easy to alter so that it can do more later.

+ While it’s difficult to get exact figures for value and cost, asking the following questions will give you insight into the potential expense of a bit of code:
    + 1. How difficult was it to write?
    + 2. How hard is it to understand?
    + 3. How expensive will it be to change?

+ Duplication of logic suggests that there are concepts hidden in the code that are not yet visible because they haven’t been isolated and named.

冗余的代码表明代码里有隐藏的未被挖掘出的概念

+ Terminology: Method versus Message(方法和消息的区别) 对 **他俩是有区别的**
    + A "method" is defined on an object, and contains behavior.
    + In the example, the `Bottle` class defines a method named song
    + A "message" is sent by an object to invoke behavior. In the aforementioned example, the song method sends the verses message to the implicit receiver self.
    + **Therefore, methods are defined, and messages are sent.**
    + Think of objects as black boxes. Methods are defined within a black box. Messages are passed between them.

+ Creating a method requires identifying the code you’d like to extract and deciding on a method name. This, in turn, requires naming the concept, and naming things is just plain hard.

定义一个方法需要把能把隐含的概念提取出来, 然后给他一个名字, 命名是一件很难的事

+ Combining many ideas into a small section of code makes it difficult to isolate and name any single concept.

如果在很少的代码里掺杂了太多的概念, 太多的隐含的概念, 那么就会很难命名, 很难区分出来这段代码到底做了什么

+ When you first write a piece of code, you obviously know what it does.
+ Therefore, during initial development, the price you pay for poor names is relatively low.
+ However, code is read many more times than it is written, and its ultimate cost is often very high and paid by someone else.

期初代码量小, 项目简单时, 很容易懂, 命名的重要性体现不出来
但随着项目向前推进, 逐步迭代时, 就会意识到"糟糕的命名"的弊端

代码写出来后, 被读的次数会比写的次数多得多; 这时候, 最初名称没有选好的弊端会进一步被放大
(亲身经历过被糟糕的命名带入坑里, 非常恼火)

+ Writing code is like writing a book; your efforts are for other readers.
+ Although the struggle for good names is painful, it is worth the effort if you wish your efforts to survive to be read.
+ Code clarity is built upon names.

写代码就像写书一样, 花费的力气是为了读代码的人更快更好的理解代码(当然少不了实际运行产生价值)
虽然起名是件很难, 甚至很痛苦的事情, 但是在这上面花时间是值得的, 因为每起一个好名字, 代表着一个概念被理清了, 这种感觉很棒, 结果也会越来越好

代码的清晰程度建立在良好的命名上(变量/方法/模块/包/功能/架构...)

+ The best way to judge code would be to compare its value to its cost, but unfortunately it’s hard to get good data.

评价代码好坏的最好方法是对比它的价值和成本; 但可惜的是代码的价值和成本很难量化

+ Asking the following questions will give you insight into the potential expense of a bit of code:
    1. How difficult was it to write?
    2. How hard is it to understand?
    3. How expensive will it be to change?

评价代码好坏可以通过问这三个问题得到一些感性的认识

这些代码好写吗? 容易实现吗?
这些代码好懂吗?
这些代码容易修改, 以适应需求变化或者功能迭代吗?

+ The very act of looking at a piece of code declares that you wish to understand it at this moment.
+ Questions 1 and 3 above may or may not concern you, but question 2 always applies.

+ Code is easy to understand when it clearly reflects the problem it’s solving and thus openly exposes that problem’s domain.

当代码清晰的描述了它解决的问题的时候, 它可以说是易读的
(TODO: "and thus openly exposes that problem’s domain." 是什么意思?)

+ Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it quickly becomes tedious in code.
简洁是一种智慧, 但是写代码时过于追求简洁可能有害
