+ Complexity seems both natural and inevitable;

+ Where you once optimized code for understandability, you now focus on its changeability. Your code is less concrete but more abstract—you’ve made it initially harder to understand in hopes that it will ultimately be easier to maintain.

+ This is the basic promise of Object-Oriented Design (OOD): that if you’re willing to accept increases in the complexity of your code along some dimensions, you’ll be rewarded with decreases in complexity along others. OOD doesn’t claim to be free; it merely asserts that its benefits outweigh its costs.

+ **Design decisions inevitably involve trade-offs.**
最好在权衡发生的时候, 能理清到底权衡了什么

+ DRY is a great idea, but that doesn’t mean it’s free. The price you pay for DRYing out code is that the invoker of the new method no longer knows the result, only the message it should send.

+ Did you divide one large class into many small ones? You can now reuse the new classes independently of one another, but it’s no longer obvious how they fit together for the original case.

+ The examples above change code by increasing its level of abstraction.

+ DRYing out code **inserts a level of indirection** between the place that uses behavior and the place that defines it.

一层抽象, 一层间接

+ Injecting a dependency transforms the receiver into something that depends on an abstract role rather than a concrete class.

依赖注入(DI), 依赖于抽象, 而非依赖于具体的实现

+ Each of these design choices has costs, and it only makes sense to pay these costs if you also accrue some offsetting benefits. Design is thus about picking the right abstractions.
    + If you choose well, your code will be expressive, understandable and flexible, and everyone will love both it and you. However
    + If you get the abstractions wrong, your code will be convoluted, confusing, and costly, and your programming peers will hate you.

+ Unfortunately, **abstractions are hard**, and even with the best of intentions, it’s easy to get them wrong.

"抽象" 这件事很难, 即使花费很多精力 也不一定做得好; 要多多练习, 多思考

+ **You can’t create the right abstraction until you fully understand the code**, but the existence of the wrong abstraction may prevent you from ever doing so.

+ **This suggests that you should not reach for abstractions, but instead, you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.**

只有当你完全看懂了代码以后, 才有可能做出合适的抽象

所以, 当你有"是不是应该做抽象"念头的时候, 应该抑制住这种冲动(和做性能优化类似, 先要忍住 https://wiki.c2.com/?RulesOfOptimization), 直到 它呼之欲出的时候, 再做

+ This book is about finding the right abstraction. This first chapter starts by peeling away the fog of complexity and defining what it means to write simple code.

+ 复杂性是正常的, 且无法避免
+ 太关注代码的可读性/易理解性, 可能会使他丧失很多容易修改的特性
+ 太过具体的代码 易读 但 不容易修改和扩展
+ 太过抽象的代码 易于修改和扩展 但 不容易理解, 因为抽象给代码增加了很多不直观的部分
+ OOD不是银弹, 但是如果愿意接受并做出适当的取舍, OOD能保证在失去一定的可读性,增加一定的抽象后, 代码在变得更复杂的过程中, 能获得更好的可维护性和扩展性
    + 必须要有取舍
+ 将一个大的class拆分为多个小的类, 好处是各个小类都(可能)是可重用, 可插拔的小模块; 代价是没法直观的看出各部分是怎么配合完成一件事的了
+ 将依赖注入到另一个一个场景(或者一个类里), 本质含义是让这个类依赖于另一个类提供的接口, 而不是依赖于某个具体的类
    + 依赖于接口的好处是: 当某种实现不再满足需求或者需要重构时, 只需要替换为一个新的类的实例(这个类实现的接口和原来的类一致), 调用方的代码不需要做任何调整(Y)
+ 即使意愿非常美好, 花费了很多的努力, **好的抽象/适度的抽象**也还是很难做到的事情, 并且很容易会把它做错
+ 只有当对代码/系统了如指掌的时候才有可能做出适当的抽象; 因此, 当有"做出抽象"的想法时, 第一个念头应该是 "先不要急着抽象", 直到这种抽象**非做不可**的时候再动手
