1. How difficult was it to write?

不太好写

2. How hard is it to understand?

有点儿绕

3. How expensive will it be to change?

看起来还行, 应该好改

+ Aside from the song and verses methods, the code does two basic things.
+ First, it defines templates for each kind of verse
+ Second, it chooses the appropriate template for a specific verse number and renders that verse’s lyrics

除开song/verses方法, 剩下的这些代码做了两件事
1. 定义模板
2. 为不同的情况选择不同的模板

+ This choosing/rendering code is overly complicated, and while complexity is not forbidden, it is required to pay its own way.

这些代码里, 选择使用哪个模板, 并且渲染模板的代码过于复杂了
虽然代码允许有复杂性, 但是复杂性一定得有相应的收益才行
