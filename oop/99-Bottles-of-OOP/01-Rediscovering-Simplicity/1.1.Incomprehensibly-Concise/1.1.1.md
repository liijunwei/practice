+ Creating a method requires identifying the code youâ€™d like to extract and deciding on a method name. This, in turn, requires naming the concept, and naming things is just plain hard.

+ When you first write a piece of code, you obviously know what it does. Therefore, during initial development, the price you pay for poor names is relatively low. However, code is read many more times than it is written, and its ultimate cost is often very high and paid by someone else.

+ Writing code is like writing a book; your efforts are for other readers. Although the struggle for good names is painful, it is worth the effort if you wish your efforts to survive to be read. Code clarity is built upon names.
