处理他们的方法不是一口气全优化掉, 而应该是耐心的一个一个处理

+ Thanks to Fowler’s book, if you can identify a smell within code, you can look up the curative refactoring, and apply it to remove the flaw.

关于code smells, 已经有人做过了专门的研究, 对code smell做了分类和分析

如果你能识别出代码里的坏味道, 那么只需要去梳理查询对应的处理/重构技巧, 然后应用到代码里就好了(Easy part)

+ **Fowler’s book is an excellent investment.** Also, if you prefer your examples in Ruby, you may be interested in **Jay Fields**' version of the book.

+ A complete exploration of every code smell is beyond the scope of this book, especially since **Mr. Fowler** has covered the topic so thoroughly.

+ Task at hand is to identify the smells in the current Bottles class.

当务之急是找出代码里的坏味道

+ The easiest way to unearth(挖掘/发掘/发现) these smells is to make a list of the things you dislike about the code.
