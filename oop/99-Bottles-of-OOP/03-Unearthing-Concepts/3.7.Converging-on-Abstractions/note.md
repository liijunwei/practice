## 3.7.1. Focusing on Difference

+ While it’s true that there are problems for which the solution is obvious, those of any interesting size aren’t tractable to instant understanding. They’re too big, or have too many parts.

虽然有的问题看起来解决方案显而易见

但是有趣的问题, 他们的复杂度使得他们不那么容易理解, 不容易解决

这些问题太大, 太复杂, 他们有太多的组成部分

+ When examining complicated problems, the eye is first drawn towards sameness.

当研究复杂的问题时, 眼睛首先会被吸引到相同的地方

+ However, despite the fact that sameness is easier to identify, difference is more useful because it has more meaning.

然而, 尽管相同性更容易识别, 但差异性更有用, 因为它具有更多意义
