## 3.7.1. Focusing on Difference

+ While it’s true that there are problems for which the solution is obvious, those of any interesting size aren’t tractable to instant understanding. They’re too big, or have too many parts.

虽然有的问题看起来解决方案显而易见

但是有趣的问题, 他们的复杂度使得他们不那么容易理解, 不容易解决

这些问题太大, 太复杂, 他们有太多的组成部分

+ When examining complicated problems, the eye is first drawn towards sameness.

当研究复杂的问题时, 眼睛首先会被吸引到相同的地方

+ However, despite the fact that sameness is easier to identify, difference is more useful because it has more meaning.

然而, 尽管相同性更容易识别, 但差异性更有用, 因为它具有更多意义

+ This influential book describes **twenty-three patterns or solutions to common OO programming problems** and it explains this process thusly:

> The focus here is encapsulating the concept that varies, a theme of many design patterns.

+ Difference holds the key to understanding.

差异是理解代码的关键

+ If two concrete examples represent the same abstraction and they contain a difference, that difference must represent a smaller abstraction within the larger one.

如果两个实体代表了相同的抽象, 并且他们包含了差异, 那么这些差异一定代表了更高层次的抽象

+ If you can name the difference, you’ve identified that smaller abstraction.

如果你能识别出这些差异, 你就能识别出这些(小的)抽象
