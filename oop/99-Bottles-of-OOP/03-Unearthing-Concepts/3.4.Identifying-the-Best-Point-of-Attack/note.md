+ If you are unclear about how to make it open (which is often the case), the way forward is to start removing code smells.

如果你不确定在么把代码变得对扩展开放, 可以先从消除代码的坏味道开始

+ If the smells aren’t immediately obvious, start by making a list of the things you find objectionable(令人反感的).

如果代码的坏味道也不好找, 就从列出代码中最让你反感的列表开始
