+ When faced with the need to change code, very often the hardest decision is where to start.

当需要修改代码时, 通常来说最困难的选择是"从哪里开始"

+ This chapter suggested that you be guided by the Open-Closed Principle, and so separate most changes into two broad steps.

本章节建议遵循"开闭原则"来进行代码改动

这些改动大概分为两大步:

+ First, refactor the existing code to be open to the new requirement.

首先, 把现有代码重构为对新需求的扩展开放的状态

+ Next, add the new code.

然后, 添加新代码, 扩展新功能
