# 9.4. Communicating With the Future

## 9.4.1. Enriching Code with Signals

+ Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
    1. defines an expectation,
    2. executes some code, and
    3. asserts that the result matches the expectation

+ Committing to a common shape lowers the cognitive load imposed upon future readers.

+ When every test is structured in the same way, readers donâ€™t have to waste time determining if spurious differences matter.

+ Choosing to arrange tests in a similar way is a matter of programming style.
