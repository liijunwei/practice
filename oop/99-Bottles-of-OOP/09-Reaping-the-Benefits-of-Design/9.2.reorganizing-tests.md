# 9.2. Reorganizing Tests

+ Unit tests ought to tell an illuminating story.

单元测试应该把这个类做的事说清楚(故事)

+ They should demonstrate and confirm the class’s direct responsibilities, and do nothing else.

他们应该证明这个类做了职责定义的事, 不作任何其他多余的事

## 9.2.1. Gathering BottleVerse Tests

move tests from `BottlesTest` to `BottleVerseTest`

## 9.2.2. Revealing Intent

+ The problem is circular. You can’t write tests until you understand the problem, but you can’t understand the problem without writing some tests. No wonder it’s hard to get started.

这个问题有点循环意味: 如果你对问题理解的不深 就很难写出好的测试, 如果你不写测试 又很难理解问题

所以开头很困难

+ Even so, here is where writing tests first really shines. It’s far better to struggle with a test that you don’t understand than to write code that you don’t understand.

写测试代码的闪光之处在于: 写出让人看不明白的测试代码 要比 写出让人看不明白的应用程序的代码要好得多(问题暴露地更早)

+ Tests force you to clarify your intentions because they make explicit assertions. Code has no such pressure, and can be left a confusing mess forever.

因为测试代码(用例)迫使你澄清你的意图, 因为每个测试用例里面都要做出明确的断言

应用程序的代码则没有这种压力, 他们即使意图不清, 难于理解, 可能也不会被关注到, 因为他们可能永远不需要被改动(因此无需被彻底理解)

+ The test_the_first_verse/test_another_verse tests exist to show that the lyrics of verses from 99 through 3 follow a similar rule, but nothing about their names gives any hint of this rule’s existence.

+ The bodies of the tests are fine, the problem is in their names.

+ These vague names were perfectly acceptable when they were the best you could do, but now you know more and can do better. It’s time to improve the story.

+ The names of these two tests should convey the following:
    + this is a verse test
    + a rule exists
    + it applies to most verses
    + it involves a range
    + one test is for the upper bound
    + the other test is for the lower bound

+ Names like `test_verse_general_rule_upper_bound` and `test_verse_general_rule_lower_bound` perfectly satisfy these constraints.
