# 9.3. Seeking Context Independence

+ An object’s **context** is its surrounding environment, or the interrelated(相互关联) conditions under which it can exist.

+ Objects are more usable when they know less.
    + Objects that expect little of their surroundings can be more easily applied to novel situations, and so provide greater utility.
    + The most useful are those that are entirely independent of context; they have no expectations about, and make no demands upon the external world.

+ As far as context goes, ignorance truly is bliss.

就上下文而言, 无知真的很幸福

+ This section explores these ideas by examining the Bottles class and its remaining tests with an eye towards reducing their context.

本节通过检查`Bottles`类和它剩下的测试用例来探索这些想法, 希望能减少`Bottles`的上下文
