+ Instead of writing classes that contain a bunch of conditionals that choose behavior, polymorphism asks you to disperse variants of behavior into classes of their own.

原来多态是这么玩的吗

+ **Factories are where conditionals go to die.**

+ This chapter explored the various forms a factory might take, and considered the trade-offs involved.

+ No factory is perfect for every situation.
    + whether it is open or closed
    + whether it owns the choosing logic or asks candidates if they should be chosen
    + whether it reaches out for registrants or accept volunteers

+ All factories, however, enable polymorphism and thus improve your code.
