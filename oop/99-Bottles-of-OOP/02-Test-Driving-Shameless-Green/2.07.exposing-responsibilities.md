+ The plan is for the verses(a, b) method to take two arguments.

+ Duplication is useful when it supplies independent, specific examples of a general concept that you don’t yet understand.

+ For example, in the prior section, the case statement within verse evolved to contain four different templates. Those templates are concrete examples of a more generic verse.
+ **Each supplies unique information, but together they point you towards the underlying abstraction.**

+ In Chapter 28 of Test-Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck describes different ways to make tests pass. Three of his "Green Bar Patterns" are:
    + Fake It ("Til You Make It")
    + Obvious Implementation
    + Triangulate(三角测量)

+ The small steps of TDD act to incrementally reveal the correct implementation.

+ Fake It style TDD may initially seem awkward and tedious, but with practice it becomes both natural and speedy.

+ Developing the habit of writing just enough code to pass the tests forces you to write better tests.

+ Triangulation is meant to force you to converge(收敛) upon the correct abstraction in your code.

+ These concrete code examples often contain some duplication, **but this duplication is fine as long as each overall example is independent and unique.**
