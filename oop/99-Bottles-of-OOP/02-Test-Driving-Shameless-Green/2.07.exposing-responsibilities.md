+ The plan is for the verses(a, b) method to take two arguments.

+ Duplication is useful when it supplies independent, specific examples of a general concept that you don’t yet understand.

在没理解某个概念之前, 让代码重复是可以接受的; 当重构到一定的阶段, 一些pattern会显现出来, 这时候再通过抽象来消除重复代码才是合适的; 不好的抽象 比 不抽象 更糟糕

+ For example, in the prior section, the case statement within verse evolved to contain four different templates. Those templates are concrete examples of a more generic verse.
+ **Each supplies unique information, but together they point you towards the underlying abstraction.**

通过重构, 代码本身隐藏的概念/抽象会渐渐显露出来, 好像 业务本身想要说话一样, 只是透过我们(programmers)表达出来

+ In Chapter 28 of Test-Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck describes different ways to make tests pass. Three of his "Green Bar Patterns" are:
    + Fake It ("Til You Make It")
    + Obvious Implementation
    + Triangulate(三角测量)

+ The small steps of TDD act to incrementally reveal the correct implementation.

代码变得更清晰, 更干净, 更简单之后, 才能真正理解业务

+ Fake It style TDD may initially seem awkward and tedious, but with practice it becomes both natural and speedy.

+ Developing the habit of writing just enough code to pass the tests forces you to write better tests.

先追求 "shameless green", or "make it work", then make it right, at last, make it fast(if necessary)

+ Triangulation is meant to force you to converge(收敛) upon the correct abstraction in your code.

+ These concrete code examples often contain some duplication, **but this duplication is fine as long as each overall example is independent and unique.**

对重复代码 要有一定的容忍度
