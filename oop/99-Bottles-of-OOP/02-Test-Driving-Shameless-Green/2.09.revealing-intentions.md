+ Kent Beck explains the difference between intention and implementation.
    + The distinction between intention and implementation [...] allows you to understand a computation first in essence and later, if necessary, in detail(Implementation Patterns (p. 69) Kent Beck)

intention 是 api(abstraction)
implementation 是 具体实现

+ Here `song` is the intention, and `verse(99, 0)` is the implementation.
+ There’s a big difference between wanting the lyrics for a range of verses, and wanting the lyrics for the entire song.

song方法是意图
verse(99, 0)方法是具体的实现

+ Bottles now produces that correct output,and it’s tempting to walk away at this point.
+ However, doing so transfers the burden of keeping this code running to some poor downstream programmer, one who has far less understanding of the problem than you do right now.

"shameless green"解法得到的代码已经能正确工作了, 这时候很容易会有"这种代码已经够好了"的感觉

然后, 如果就这样不再去优化这个段代码, 就是把维护代码的负担转移给了其他使用这段代码的人了, 他可能对这个问题(实现)了解很少, 并不知道为什么要这么做

下一节将会把测试补充全, 通过测试来揭示这段代码的意图
