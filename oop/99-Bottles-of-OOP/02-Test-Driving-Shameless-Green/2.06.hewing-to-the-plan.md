+ As you’ve seen, when working towards Shameless Green, it makes sense sometimes to eliminate duplication and other times to retain it.

在靠近"Shameless Green"目标的路上, 有时候需要去除代码冗余, 有时候需要容忍代码的冗余

+ Shameless Green solution is optimized to be straightforward and intention-revealing, and it doesn’t much concern itself with changeability or future maintenance.

"Shameless Green"目的是 不断优化已有代码, 让代码变得能清晰的传达它的意图, 能一点一点揭露出问题的本质; 不对代码的可变性或者代码的可维护性做过多的考虑

+ **The goal is to use green to maximize your understanding of the problem and to unearth all available information before committing to abstractions.**

使用"Shameless Green"的目标是 加深对问题的理解, 在获取足够信息前, 尽量不去做抽象(不合适的抽象 有害)

+ You should complete the entire horizontal path before indulging in any vertical digressions.

第一步应该是先让测试通过, 然后再去做其他优化(优先级可能更低)

+ Use of if / elsif implies that each subsequent condition varies in a meaningful way.
+ In contrast, use of case implies that every condition checks for equality against an explicit value.

+ In the 99 Bottles case above, the conditions are fundamentally the same.

+ **Intention-revealing code is built from the accumulation of such thoughtful acts.**

+ With the end in sight, the cost of finishing the horizontal path is low. Once it’s complete, you’ll have an example of every different kind of verse, and therefore maximal information about the problem.
