+ The plan is for the verses(a, b) method to take two arguments.

+ For example, in the prior section, the case statement within verse evolved to contain four different templates. Those templates are concrete examples of a more generic verse.
+ **Each supplies unique information, but together they point you towards the underlying abstraction.**

    + Fake It ("Til You Make It")
    + Obvious Implementation
    + Triangulate(三角测量)
