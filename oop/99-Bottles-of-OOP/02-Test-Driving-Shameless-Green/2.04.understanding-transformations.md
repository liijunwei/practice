+ In the Transformation Priority Premise, Martin defines Transformations as "simple operations that change the behavior of code."

Transformation: 一系列对代码的小的改动

+ Not only does he describe a set of transformations that move code from more specific to more generic, he arranges these transformations in "priority" order, from simpler to more complex.

通过一系列的小的改动, 把代码由具体逐渐改为更抽象

把这一系列的改动排好优先级, 由简单到困难

+ He asserts that when a problem can be solved with any one of several transformations, the transformation with the highest priority is simplest and therefore best.

一个问题能够通过一些小的改动逐渐向解决方案靠近
