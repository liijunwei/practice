+ The choice of the best alternative for verse 3 was guided both by metrics and the "Transformation Priority Premise," and those things might again be useful here.
(page 57 Table 2.2)

+ As was stated in the previous section, as tests get more specific, code should become more generic.

前面说过, 随着测试用例变得更加具体, 代码应该变得更加通用

+ Code becomes more generic by becoming more abstract.

代码通过变得更抽象 以获得 通用性

+ One way to make code more abstract is to DRY it out, that is, to extract duplicate bits of code into a single method, to give that method a name, and then to refer to the code by this new name.

一种方法是通过DRY, 把重复的代码提取为方法, 在各处调用方法

+ DRYing out code removes the duplication and thus reduces its overall size.
