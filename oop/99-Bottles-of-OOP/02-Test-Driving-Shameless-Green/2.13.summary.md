+ Testing, done well, speeds development and lowers costs.

如果TDD里的测试实践得当的话, 可以加快开发速度, 降低成本

+ Unfortunately it’s also true that flawed tests slow you down and cost you money.

但同样, 如果做得不好, TDD会降低开发速度, 并且成本很高

+ It is worth the effort, therefore, to get good at testing.

花精力掌握写好的测试用例时值得的

+ TDD can prevent costly guesses, but only if you commit to writing code in small steps.

+ Tests can make it safe and easy to refactor, but only if they are carefully de-coupled from the current code.

测试能够让重构变得简单/安全

但是前提是测试用例和代码之间没有太多耦合

+ Good tests not only tell a story, but they lead, step by step, to a well-organized solution.

好的测试用例不仅能帮助理解代码

还能一步一步把代码引向好的解决方案

+ The tests written in this chapter give rise (assuming proper restraint on the part of the programmer) to Shameless Green.

**give rise to ...**

本章中编写的测试(假设程序员有适当的限制)产生了Shameless Green的解决方案

+ The Shameless Green solution is neither clever nor extensible.

Shameless Green的解决方案既不够"聪明", 扩展性也不是很好

+ Its value lies in the fact that the code is easy to understand, and cheap to write. If nothing ever changes, this solution is quite certainly good enough.

但是它的价值是 这样的代码容易理解, 并且很容易就能写出来

如果没有什么改动, 大可以把这个代码部署好一直让它运行下去(不再修改)

**Good Enough**
good enough
good enough

+ Things get more interesting only if something needs to change.

只有当情况发生变化时, 代码需要响应的做出扩展, 这时候有趣的变化才会发生

+ So, on to Chapter 3, which introduces a new requirement, and forces you to make some hard decisions about the code.

第三章将为Bottles引入新的需求

新的需求会迫使反思代码, 做出选择
