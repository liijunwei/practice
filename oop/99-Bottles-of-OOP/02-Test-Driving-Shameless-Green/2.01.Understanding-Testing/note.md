+ The practice of writing tests before writing code become known as test- driven development (TDD).

先写出测试用例, 再去写具体实现的这种实践被称为TDD(测试驱动开发)

+ 它的流程如下

1. Write a test. 写测试用例
Because the code does not yet exist, this test fails. Test runners usually
display failing tests in red.

2. Make it run. 运行测试用例
Write the code to make the test pass. Test runners commonly display passing tests in green.

3. Make it right. 编写实现的代码, 让测试通过
Each time you return to green, you can refactor any code into a better shape, confident that it remains correct if the tests continue to pass.
