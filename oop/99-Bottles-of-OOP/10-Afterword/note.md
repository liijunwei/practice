+ Completing this book is an accomplishment, and you deserve to take a minute to revel in your success before moving on.

+ Regardless of your mindset or experience level before you started, you’re different now that you’re done.(So true)

+ This book has two primary goals:
    + The first relates to process: supply concrete, repeatable techniques that you can employ to improve your own applications.
    + The second relates to perspective: it aspires to infect you with a certain perspective about object-oriented programming. This book wants you to fall in love with polymorphism.


+ Strive for simplicity
+ Don’t abstract too soon
+ Focus on smells
+ Concentrate on difference
+ Take small steps
+ Follow the Flocking Rules
+ Refactor under green
+ Fix the easy problems first
+ Work horizontally
+ Seek stable landing points
+ Be disciplined
+ Don’t chase the shiny thing.
+ Deal with new requirements by first refactoring existing code to be open to them, and then writing new code to meet them.
    + Achieving openness is usually the more challenging task, but can be sought in absolute safety if you have tests that act as a wall at your back.

+ The canons are practical rules that guide the programming process. Adhering to them will lower your stress, speed up your work, and improve your code. **If you commit to nothing more than to follow them, your reading time will have been well spent.**

+ The secret to programming happiness is to combine the canons with the infection, building applications from polymorphic, trustworthy objects, and changing them one step at a time.

+ one last request: Hold high standards, but judge yourself gently.
    + Perfection is just not that likely.
    + Most times the requirements you’re given aren’t quite right, or are incompletely conveyed, or misunderstood, or about to change, ad nauseam.
    + Circumstances conspire to make it hard to get everything exactly right, despite your best efforts.
