+ You don’t have to understand the entire problem in order to find and express the correct abstractions—you merely apply these rules, repeatedly, and abstractions will naturally appear.

目标拆分, 一步一步走, 一口一口吃

+ Consider this question: If several different programmers started from Shameless Green and refactored the verse method according to the Flocking Rules, what would the resulting code look like?

思考这个问题: 如果多个工程师从"Shameless Green"状态的代码开始重构这部分代码

大家都用通过应用"Flocking Rules"来实现重构, 那么最后的代码会长的一样吗?

+ If you’ve guessed that everyone’s code would be identical, excepting the names used for the concepts, you’d be right. This has enormous value.

如果你猜测大家最终的代码结构差不多一样, 只是方法的名字(抽象后的概念命名)可能有些不同, 那就猜对了, 这是应用"Flocking Rules"法则的重大价值
