+ Abstractions are beneficial in many ways.

抽象在多方面有益

+ They consolidate code into a single place so that it can be changed with ease.

他们把代码整合到一个地方, 以便于修改

+ They name this consolidated code, allowing the name to be used as a shortcut for an idea, independent of its current implementation.

"抽象"为某段代码统一命名, 允许将该名称用作某种想法的统一实现方式, 不受其他东西影响

+ These are valuable benefits, but abstractions also help in another, more subtle, way.

上面说的那些益处很有意义, 但是"抽象"在另一方面有这更精妙的好处

+ In addition to the above, abstractions tell you where your code relies upon an idea.

除了前面说到的好处, "抽象"还能告诉你: 代码在哪里依赖于一个想法(Idea)

+ But to get this last benefit, you must refer to an abstraction in every place where it applies.

但是为了得到最后的那个好处, 你必须在每个可以使用该抽象的地方使用它
