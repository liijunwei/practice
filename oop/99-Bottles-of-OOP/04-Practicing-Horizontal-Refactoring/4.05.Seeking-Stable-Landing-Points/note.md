+ Notice the similarities in the above methods. Each has a single responsibility.

+ They are identical in shape.

+ All take the same argument.

+ Each contains a conditional and that conditional tests the argument against a specific value; it checks to see if the argument is equal to something, as opposed to greater or less than something.

+ These methods are incredibly consistent, and this did not happen by accident --- theyâ€™re a direct result of the refactoring rules.
