+ Notice the similarities in the above methods. Each has a single responsibility.

+ They are identical in shape.

+ All take the same argument.

+ Each contains a conditional and that conditional tests the argument against a specific value; it checks to see if the argument is equal to something, as opposed to greater or less than something.

+ These methods are incredibly consistent, and **this did not happen by accident --- they’re a direct result of the refactoring rules.**

+ The rules lead to consistent code, and **consistency matters deeply**.

+ First, it makes code easy to understand.

+ **Code is read many more times than it is written**, so anything that increases understandability lowers costs.

+ Next, and just as important, **consistent code enables future refactorings.**

+ If you follow the rules of refactoring, you’ll quickly pass over the slippery places, and arrive at stable, consistent resting points.
