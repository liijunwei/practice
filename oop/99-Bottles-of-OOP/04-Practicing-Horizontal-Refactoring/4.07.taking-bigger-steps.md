```ruby
  def verse(number)
    case number
    when 0
      # ...
      "Go to the store and buy some more, " +
      # ...
    else
      # ...
      "#{quantity(number).capitalize} #{container(number)} of beer on the wall, " +
      # ...
    end
  end
```

+ The only thing the above lines have in common is the trailing ", " , which means that everything up to that point is a difference.

+ If the 0 and else verse variants reflect a common verse abstraction, this difference must represent a smaller concept within that larger abstraction.

+ **It doesn’t matter how long these strings are, their presence here in opposition means they reflect a single concept.**

+ **You must name the concept, create a method to represent it, and then replace this difference with a message send.**

+ The first step is therefore to name the category in which these two phrase are concrete examples.

+ Until now, you’ve been doing this refactoring in the smallest possible steps. As a reminder, those steps are:
    + Define a method for the concept. 识别概念, 方法命名
    + Alter it to return one of the differences. 实现方法
    + Replace that difference with a message send. 用方法替换不同之处
    + Add the number argument to the new method, with appropriate default. 为方法增加默认值
    + Implement the conditional. 为方法增加判断
    + Pass the number argument from the current sender. 为方法传参
    + Send the message from the other branch, this time including the number argument. 为方法传参
    + Clean up. 清理代码
