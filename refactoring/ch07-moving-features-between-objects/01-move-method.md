+ Moving methods is the bread and butter of refactoring(重构的基础)

+ I move methods when classes have too much behavior or when classes are collaborating too much and are too highly coupled
+ By moving methods around, I can make the classes simpler, and they end up being a more crisp implementation of a set of responsibilities.
