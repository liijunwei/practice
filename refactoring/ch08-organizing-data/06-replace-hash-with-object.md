You have a Hash that stores several different types of objects, and is passed around and used for more than one purpose.

*Replace the Hash with an object that has a field for each key.*

+ Like Arrays, Hashes are a common structure for organizing data.
    + **Outside the context of named parameters, they should only be used to store a collection of similar objects.**
