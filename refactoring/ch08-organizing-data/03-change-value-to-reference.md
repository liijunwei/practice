You have a class with many equal instances that you want to replace with a single object.

*Turn the object into a reference object.*(unclear)

+ TODO question: what is "Replace Constructor with Factory Method." and why we ues it?

+ reference objects
    + things like customer or account
    + stands for one object in the real world
    + use the object iden- tity to test whether they are equal

+ value objects
    + things like date or money.(also can be reference object???)
    + They are defined entirely through their data values(unclear)
    + You don't mind that copies exist
