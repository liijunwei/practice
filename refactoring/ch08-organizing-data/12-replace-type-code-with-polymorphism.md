You have a type code that affects the behavior of a class.

*Replace the type code with classes: one for each type code variant.*

+ There are three different refactorings to consider when youâ€™re trying to remove conditional logic:
    + Replace Type Code with `Polymorphism`
    + Replace Type Code with `Module Extension`
    + Replace Type Code with `State/Strategy`
    + The choice depends on relatively subtle design differences
