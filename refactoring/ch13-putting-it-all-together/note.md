### Q: Why are all these wonderful techniques really only the beginning?

+ Because you don't yet know when to use them and when not to, when to start and when to stop, when to go and when to wait.
+ It is the rhythm that makes for refactorsing, not the individual notes.

### Q: How will you know when you are really getting it?

+ You'll know when you start to calm down.
+ When you feel absolute confidence that no matter how screwed up someone left it, you can make the code better, enough better to keep making progress.
