### Q: Why are all these wonderful techniques really only the beginning?

+ Because you don't yet know when to use them and when not to, when to start and when to stop, when to go and when to wait.
+ It is the rhythm that makes for refactorsing, not the individual notes.

### Q: How will you know when you are really getting it?

+ You'll know when you start to calm down.
+ **When you feel absolute confidence that no matter how screwed up someone left it, you can make the code better, enough better to keep making progress.**

+ Mostly, though, you'll know you're getting it when you can stop with confidence.
+ **Stopping is the strongest move in the refactorer's repertoire.**

这种心态真的太好了! 我已经有一点点这种感觉了(虽然重构技术用得还很不熟练)

+ If the code is already better, integrate and release what you've done.
+ If it isn't better, walk away. Flush it. Glad to have learned a lesson, pity it didn't work out. What's on for tomorrow?

+ You bed down for the night, sure the sun will rise again in the morning.
