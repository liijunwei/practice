The name of a method does not reveal its purpose.

*Change the name of the method.*

+ Methods should be named in a way that communicates their intention.

+ If you see a badly named method, it is imperative that you change it.
+ Remember your code is for a human first and a computer second.
+ Humans need good names.
+ **Take note of when you have spent ages trying to do something that would have been easier if a couple of methods had been better named.**
+ **Good naming is a skill that requires practice; improving this skill is the key to being a truly skillful programmer.**
+ The same applies to other aspects of the signature.
+ If reordering parameters clarifies matters, do it (see Add Parameter and Remove Parameter).
