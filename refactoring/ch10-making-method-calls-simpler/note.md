**Objects are all about interfaces.**

Coming up with interfaces that are easy to understand and use is a key skill in developing good Object-Oriented software.

This chapter explores refactorings that **make interfaces more straightforward**.

**Often the simplest and most important thing you can do is to change the name of a method.**

Naming is a key tool in communication.

If you understand what a program is doing, you should not be afraid to use `Rename Method` to pass on that knowledge.

You can (and should) also rename variables and classes.

On the whole these renamings are fairly simple text replacements, so I havenâ€™t added extra refactorings for them.
