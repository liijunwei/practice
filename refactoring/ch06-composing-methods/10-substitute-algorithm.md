# Substitute Algorithm

Replace the body of the method with the new algorithm.

这有什么好说的...

## Motivation

+ If you find a clearer way to do something, you should replace the complicated way with the clearer way.

+ When you have to take this step, make sure you have decomposed the method as much as you can.
+ Substituting a large, complex algorithm is difficult; only by making it simple can you make the substitution tractable.
