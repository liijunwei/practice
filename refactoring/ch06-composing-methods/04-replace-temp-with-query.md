# Replace Temp with Query

You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression.

Extract the expression into a method. Replace all references to the temp with the expression. The new method can then be used in other methods.

+ The problem with temps is that they are temporary and local.
+ Because they can be seen only in the context of the method in which they are used, temps tend to encourage longer methods, because thatâ€™s the only way you can reach the temp.

+ Replace Temp with Query often is a vital step before Extract Method.
+ Local variables make it difficult to extract, so replace as many variables as you can with queries.

+ Initially mark the method as private. You may find more use for it later, but you can easily relax the protection then.

+ Ensure the extracted method is free of side effectsâ€”that is, it does not modify any object.
    + If it is not free of side effects, use Separate Query from Modifier.
    + what is "Separate Query from Modifier" ?

+ You may be concerned about performance in this case.
    + As with other performance issues, let it slide for the moment.
    + Nine times out of ten, it wonâ€™t matter.
    + When it does matter, you will fix the problem during optimization.
    + With your code better factored, you often find more powerful optimizations that you would have missed without refactoring.
    + If worse comes to worst, itâ€™s easy to put the temp back.
    +
    + do not worry about performance too early, use profilers before optimizating

```ruby
# before
def price
  base_price = @quantity * @item_price

  if base_price > 1000
    discount_factor = 0.95
  else
    discount_factor = 0.98
  end

  base_price * discount_factor
end

# after
def price
  base_price * discount_factor
end

def base_price
  @quantity * @item_price
end

def discount_factor
  base_price > 1000 ? 0.95 : 0.98
end
```
