# Replace Temp with Query

You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression.

Extract the expression into a method. Replace all references to the temp with the expression. The new method can then be used in other methods.

+ The problem with temps is that they are temporary and local.
+ Because they can be seen only in the context of the method in which they are used, temps tend to encourage longer methods, because thatâ€™s the only way you can reach the temp.
