+ Divergent Change 发散的变化

+ Divergent change occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons.

+ Shotgun surgery is similar to divergent change but is the opposite. You whiff this when every time you make a kind of change, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes.

+ Divergent change is one class that suffers many kinds of changes, and shotgun surgery is one change that alters many classes.

+ The whole point of objects is that they are a technique to package data with the processes used on that data.

+ The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together.

+ Data Clumps
    + Don’t worry about data clumps that use only some of the attributes of the new object. As long as you are replacing two or more instance variables with the new object, you’ll come out ahead.
    + Reducing instance variable lists and parameter lists will certainly remove a few bad smells, but once you have the objects, you get the opportunity to make a nice perfume.

+ Primitive Obsession(mind blowing)
