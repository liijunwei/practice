# Toward a Catalog of Refactorings

Chapters 5 to 12 form an initial catalog of refactorings.

## Format of the Refactorings

As I describe the refactorings in this and other chapters, I use a standard format. Each refactoring has five parts, as follows:

+ I begin with a name.

+ I follow the name with a short summary of the situation in which you need the refactoring and a summary of what the refactoring does.

+ The motivation describes why the refactoring should be done and describes circumstances in which it shouldnâ€™t be done.

+ The mechanics are a concise, step-by-step description of how to carry out the refactoring.

+ The examples show a simple use of the refactoring to illustrate how it works.
