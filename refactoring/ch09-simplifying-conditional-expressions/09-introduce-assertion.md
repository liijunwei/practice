A section of code assumes something about the state of the program.

*Make the assumption explicit with an assertion.*

+ what is that `assert` ? a ruby keyword ?
    + or is it like the guard clause, but instead of return, it raises errors ?

+ Sometimes the assumptions are stated with a comment. A better technique is to make the assumption explicit by writing an assertion.

+ An assertion is a conditional statement that is assumed to be always true.
