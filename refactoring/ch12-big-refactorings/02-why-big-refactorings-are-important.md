+ Seriously, you refactor not because it is fun but because there are things you expect to be able to do with your programs if you refactor that you just can't do if you don't refactor.

重构不是为了好玩而做的

重构是为了能让你达成 你不重构没法做到(或者很难做到)的事情

+ Accumulation of half-understood design decisions eventually chokes a program as a water weed chokes a canal.

对设计的一知半解, 累积下来最终会让程序走向死亡(窒息), 就像水草会阻塞河流一样

+ By refactoring you can ensure that your full understanding of how the program should be designed is always reflected in the program.(unclear...)

通过重构, 可以确保你对程序应该怎么设计的充分理解 始终被反映在程序中
