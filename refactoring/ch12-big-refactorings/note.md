+ You are refactoring to some purpose, not just to avoid making progress

+ When you have a system and it's in production and you need to add functionality, you'll have a hard time persuading managers that they should stop progress for a couple of months while you tidy up.
+ Instead, you have to make like Hansel and Gretel and nibble around the edges, a little today, a little more tomorrow.

+ As you do this, you should be guided by your need to do something else.
+ Do the refactorings as you need to add function and fix bugs.
+ You don't have to complete the refactoring when you begin. Do as much as you need to achieve your real task. You can always come back tomorrow.
