+ You are refactoring to some purpose, not just to avoid making progress

+ When you have a system and it's in production and you need to add functionality, you'll have a hard time persuading managers that they should stop progress for a couple of months while you tidy up.
+ Instead, you have to make like Hansel and Gretel and nibble around the edges, a little today, a little more tomorrow.

+ As you do this, you should be guided by your need to do something else.
+ Do the refactorings as you need to add function and fix bugs.
+ You don't have to complete the refactoring when you begin. Do as much as you need to achieve your real task. You can always come back tomorrow.

+ **You will have to have faith that you are making the world a little safer for your program each day.**

+ The big refactorings require a degree of agreement among the entire programming team that isn't needed with the smaller refactorings.
+ The whole team has to recognize that one of the big refactorings is "in play" and make their moves accordingly.

大的重构 需要让团队里的所有人有意识; 一个很形象的例子是: 两个人的车听到了接近山顶的地方, 然后两个人下来推车, 一人推一边, 推了半天, 车头的人说"我从来没想到在下坡路推车也这么困难", 车尾的人感觉很奇怪, "你说 向山下推? 不是该向山上推吗?"

+ Seriously, you refactor not because it is fun but because there are things you expect to be able to do with your programs if you refactor that you just can't do if you don't refactor.

重构不是为了好玩而做的

重构是为了能让你达成 你不重构没法做到(或者很难做到)的事情

+ Accumulation of half-understood design decisions eventually chokes a program as a water weed chokes a canal.

对设计的一知半解, 累积下来最终会让程序走向死亡(窒息), 就像水草会阻塞河流一样

+ By refactoring you can ensure that your full understanding of how the program should be designed is always reflected in the program.(unclear...)

通过重构, 可以确保你对程序应该怎么设计的充分理解 始终被反映在程序中
