You have an inheritance hierarchy that is doing two jobs at once.

*Create two hierarchies and use delegation to invoke one from the other.*

+ Tangled inheritance is a problem because it leads to code duplication, the bane of the programmer's existence.
+ It makes changes more difficult, because the strategies for solving a certain kind of problem are spread around.

+ **Identify the different jobs being done by the hierarchy.**
+ Decide which job is more important
