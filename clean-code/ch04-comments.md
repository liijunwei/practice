+ "well-placed" comment is helpful

+ "don't comment bad code, rewrite it"

+ explain yourself in Code

+ "warning of consequences"

+ "don't let your code littered with TODOs, scan through them regularly and eliminate the ones you can"

+ avoid "bad commnets"

+ **don't use a comment when you can use a function or a variable**

+ don't check "commented-out code" to git (pls...)
