+ don't be cute
    + say what you mean, mean what you say
+ don't pun(双关语)
    + avoid using the same word for two purposes
    + using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun

+ use solution domain names (to communicate with other programmers)
+ use problem domain names (to communicate with other people)
    + separating solution and problem domain concepts is part of the job a good programmer and designer
    + the code htat has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain

+ don't add gratuitous(无意义的，没来由的) context

### Final words

The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultureal background

this is a teaching issue rather than a technical, business, or managerment issue
