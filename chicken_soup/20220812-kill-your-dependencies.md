# Rules to Remember

Some software engineering rules:

+ No code runs faster             than no code
+ No code has fewer bugs          than no code
+ No code uses less memory        than no code
+ No code is easier to understand than no code

Kill those dependencies. Your gems and apps will be better for it.
